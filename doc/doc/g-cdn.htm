<h3><font color="#000080">Using Sector as a Content Distribution Network</font></h3>
<p>When a file is uploaded to Sector from one location, the file will be duplicated multiple times on other nodes. Sector duplicates files on clusters as far away as possible. If the system is deployed over wide area networks, Sector can be used as a content distribution network. This is especially useful when distributing large files since it may be impossible to have a copy of a file on all the sites. </p>
<p>As a simplified case, a Sector system can also be used as an advanced FTP server. Sector can serve files over multiple servers within a single namespace. Furthermore, users can use UDT to download files at very high speed, with optional data encryption. </p>
