<h3><font color="#000080">Configuring the Security Server </font></h3>
<p>The security server maintains  an access control list for the master/slave nodes and all the uers information. The access control list decides which node can join the Sector system as a master or slave node. The user information includes user account, password, access IP control, and file IO permission. </p>

<p><b>master_acl.conf</b></p>
<p>The &quot;master_acl.conf&quot; file includes a list of IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.0.1) or IP address ranges (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24) from which a computer can join the Sector system as a master server. Each line represents only one address or one address range. The address range is represented by bit mask. That is, 192.168.0.0/24 means 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255. By default, any node (0.0.0.0/0) can join the system as a master. </p>
<div class="code">
    #list of IP addresses or ranges from which a slave can join the system<br />
    #by default the system is open: i.e., any node can become a slave node<br />
    #you should change this for a production system<br />
    #E.g., 192.168.0.0/24 allows all IPs within 192.168.0.0-255 to join<br />
	<br />
    0.0.0.0/0<br />
</div>

<p><b>slave_acl.conf</b></p>
<p>The slave access control list has exactly the same format as master_acl.conf, except that its information is stored in slave_acl.conf. </p>
<p><b>User Accounts </b></p>
<p>The user account information is stored in ./codeblue2/conf/users. Information about each user is stored in one text file. For example, information of user &quot;test&quot; is stored in ./codeblue2/conf/users/test. </p>
<p>Currently the account informtion is only stored in clear text. We plan to encrypt them in the first production quality release. The &quot;PASSWORD&quot; section is the user's password in clear text. The &quot;READ_PERMISSION&quot; lists files or directories that the user can read, one per line. Similarily, the &quot;WRITE_PERMISSION&quot; is a list of files or directories that the user can write. The &quot;EXEC_PERMISSION&quot; is a TRUE or FALSE value that indicates if the user can run Sphere applications. The &quot;ACL&quot; lists IP addresses or IP address ranges from which the user can login, one per line. Finally, a quota of disk space usage can be applied to a user. The quota includes the total size of the writable files or directories of the user, without counting the replicas.</p>
<p>In the confiuguration file, <span class="style1">the option value must be preceded by a &quot;TAB&quot; charactor</span>. The &quot;#&quot; charactor can be used for comment lines. </p>
